You can select an item, enter a purchase quantity and if there is enough stock on hand, the app will process the sale (record the transaction and remove the sold items from inventory).

## Manager view:

You can run manager.js application to view products for sale, view low inventory products, add inventory to existing products, or add a new product to the store front.

## Supervisor view:
